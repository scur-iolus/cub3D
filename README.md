## ðŸŽ¬ About this project

I've completed this project between February and March 2022 with a friend of mine. `cub3D` is one of the mandatory projects that every 42 student has to complete as part of the core school curriculum. It has to be written in `C`. [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) is the first tuition-free computer training, open to all, regardless of diploma.

The project subject can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Aa3ez_B8eJ5OewyuFtlazmQcOI_R6-9w/view?usp=sharing). The goal of `cub3D` is to partially reproduce the world famous game `Wolfenstein 3D`, a first person shooter video game released in 1992. More precisely, we had to build from scratch a simple ray casting rendering similar to the `Wolfenstein 3D` engine.

[Wolfenstein 3D](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/) is considered one of the greatest video games ever made for mainly two reasons. Firstly, it became very quickly a huge commercial success. Secondly, it is said to be the "*grandfather of 3D shooters*": it popularized the first-person shooter genre thanks to its innovative 3D game engine.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I've learnt there

This is the first game I've ever developed. I've learnt how to use the [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) graphic library, "*a simple X-Window (X11R6) programming API in C, designed for students*". The `minilibx` is intended to be easy to use and turns out to be quite minimalist, which can be both an advantage and a drawback. We had to program from scratch the display of each frame, pixel by pixel. It was a great opportunity for me to brush up on my mathematics skills, mainly in trigonometry and in linear algebra. It's also the first time I've practiced "*pair programming*": we worked together with my mate at one workstation. While one was writing code, the other had to review each line of code as it was typed in.


## ðŸ’¡ Tips & useful resources

Here are some useful resources which could save time to future 42 school students:
